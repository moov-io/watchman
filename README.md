# moov-io/watchman

Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Moov Watchman offers download, parse, and search functions over numerous trade sanction lists from the United States, agencies, and nonprofits for complying with regional laws. Also included is a [web UI](#in-browser-watchman-search) and an async [webhook notification service](#webhook-notifications) to initiate processes on remote systems.

Lists included in search are:

- US Treasury - Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
  - [Specially Designated Nationals](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists) (SDN)
    - Includes SDN, SDN Alternative Names, SDN Addresses
  - [Sectoral Sanctions Identifications](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/consolidated-sanctions-list/sectoral-sanctions-identifications-ssi-list) (SSI)
- US Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
  - [Denied Persons List](https://bis.data.commerce.gov/dataset/Denied-Persons-List-with-Denied-US-Export-Privileg/xwtd-wd7a/data) (DPL)
  - [Entity List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list) (EL)

All United States and European Union companies are required to comply with various regulations and sanction lists (such as the US Patriot Act requiring compliance with the BIS Denied Persons List). Moov's primary usage for this project is with ACH origination in our [paygate](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate) project.

## Project status

Moov Watchman is actively used in multiple production environments. Please star the project if you are interested in its progress. If you have layers above Watchman to simplify tasks, perform business operations, or found bugs we would appreciate an issue or pull request. Thanks!

## Usage

The Watchman project implements an HTTP server and [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/watchman) for searching, parsing, and downloading lists. We also have an [example](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/watchman/examples) of the webhook service. Below, you can find a detailed list of features offered by Watchman:

- Download OFAC, BIS Denied Persons List (DPL), and various other data sources on startup
  - Admin endpoint to [manually refresh OFAC and DPL data](docs/runbook.md#force-data-refresh)
- Index data for searches
- Async searches and notifications (webhooks)
- Manual overrides to mark a `Company` or `Customer` as `unsafe` (blocked) or `exception` (never blocked).
- Library for OFAC and BIS DPL data to download and parse their custom files

### Docker

We publish a [public Docker image `moov/watchman`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/watchman/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8084` and metrics at `:9094/metrics` in Prometheus format. We also have Docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/watchman?tab=tags) published as `quay.io/moov/watchman`. Lastly, we offer a `moov/watchman:static` Docker image with files from 2019. This image can be useful for faster local testing or consistent results.

Pull & start the Docker image:
```
docker pull moov/watchman:latest
docker run -p 8084:8084 -p 9094:9094 moov/watchman:latest
```

Get information about a company using their entity ID:
```
curl "localhost:8084/ofac/companies/13374"
```
```

### Google Cloud Run

To get started in a hosted environment you can deploy this project to the Google Cloud Platform.

From your [Google Cloud dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) create a new project and call it:
```
moov-watchman-demo
```

Enable the [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) API for your project and associate a [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) if needed. Then, open the Cloud Shell terminal and run the following Docker commands, substituting your unique project ID:

```
docker pull moov/watchman
docker tag moov/watchman gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/watchman
docker push gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/watchman
```

Deploy the container to Cloud Run:
```
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/watchman --port 8084
```

Select your target platform to `1`, service name to `watchman`, and region to the one closest to you (enable Google API service if a prompt appears). Upon a successful build you will be given a URL where the API has been deployed:

```
https://YOUR-WATCHMAN-APP-URL.a.run.app
```

Now you can ping the server:
```
curl https://YOUR-WATCHMAN-APP-URL.a.run.app/ping
```
You should get this response:
```
PONG
```

| `DEBUG_NAME_PIPELINE` | Boolean to pring debug messages for each name (SDN, SSI) processing step. | `false` |

#### Storage

Based on `DATABASE_TYPE`, the following environmental variables will be read to configure connections for a specific database.

##### MySQL

- `MYSQL_ADDRESS`: TCP address for connecting to the MySQL server. (example: `tcp(hostname:3306)`)
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Name of database to connect into.
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Password of user account for authentication.
- `MYSQL_USER`: Username used for authentication.

Refer to the MySQL driver documentation for [connection parameters](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name).

- `MYSQL_TIMEOUT`: Timeout parameter specified on (DSN) data source name. (Default: `30s`)

##### SQLite

- `SQLITE_DB_PATH`: Local filepath location for the paygate SQLite database. (Default: `watchman.db`)

Refer to the SQLite driver documentation for [connection parameters](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#connection-string).

#### Webhook notifications

When Watchman sends a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) to your application, the body will contain a JSON representation of the [Company](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/watchman/client#OfacCompany) or [Customer](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/watchman/client#OfacCustomer) model as the body to a POST request. You can see an [example in Go](examples/webhook/webhook.go).

An `Authorization` header will also be sent with the `authToken` provided when setting up the watch. Clients should verify this token to ensure authenticated communicated.

Webhook notifications are ran after the OFAC data is successfully refreshed, which is determined by the `DATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL` environmental variable.

##### Watching a specific customer or company by ID

Moov Watchman supports sending a webhook periodically when a specific [Company](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/api/#post-/ofac/companies/-companyID-/watch) or [Customer](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/api/#post-/ofac/customers/-customerID-/watch) is to be watched. This is designed to update another system about an OFAC entry's sanction status.

##### Watching a customer or company name

Moov Watchman supports sending a webhook periodically with a free-form name of a [Company](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/api/#post-/ofac/companies/watch) or [Customer](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/api/#post-/ofac/customers/watch). This allows external applications to be notified when an entity matching that name is added to the OFAC list. The match percentage will be included in the JSON payload.

#### Prometheus metrics

- `http_response_duration_seconds`: A histogram of HTTP response timings.
- `last_data_refresh_success`: Unix timestamp of when data was last refreshed successfully.
- `last_data_refresh_count`: Count of records for a given sanction or entity list.
- `match_percentages` A histogram which holds the match percentages with a label (`type`) of searches.
   - `type`: Can be address, q, remarksID, name, altName
- `mysql_connections`: Number of MySQL connections and their statuses.
- `sqlite_connections`: Number of SQLite connections and their statuses.

### Data persistence

By design, Watchman  **does not persist** (save) any data about the search queries or actions created. The only storage occurs in memory of the process and upon restart Watchman will have no files or data saved. Also, no in-memory encryption of the data is performed.

### Go library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go v1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/watchman/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

```
$ git@github.com:moov-io/watchman.git

# Pull down into the Go Module cache
$ go get -u github.com/moov-io/watchman

$ go doc github.com/moov-io/watchman/client Search
```

### In-browser Watchman search

Using our [in-browser utility](https://oss.moov.io/watchman/), you can instantly perform advanced Watchman searches. Simply fill search fields and generate a detailed report that includes match percentage, alternative names, effective/expiration dates, IDs, addresses, and other useful information. This tool is particularly useful for completing quick searches with the aid of a intutive interface.

## Reporting blocks to OFAC

OFAC requires annual reports of blocked entities and [offers guidance for this report](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ofac_blocked_property_guidance.pdf). Section [31 C.F.R. § 501.603(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=be4f2a1608abec5d93170fb03af99939&mc=true&node=se31.3.501_1603&rgn=div8) requires this annual report.
