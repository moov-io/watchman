## v0.21.1 (Released 2021-10-04)

Release v0.21.1 applies bugfix to pre-computation steps to SDN alternate names.

BUG FIXES

- search: bugfix for pipeline steps to SDN alt names (#376)

## v0.21.0 (Released 2021-09-29)

Release v0.21.0 applies pre-computation steps to SDN alternate names which was previously missing. This impacts
match performance for only those results.

BUG FIXES

- search: apply pipline steps to SDN alt names (#375)

## v0.20.0 (Released 2021-08-27)

Watchman v0.20.0 improves scoring by reducing false positives. There are two changes implemented in this
release to achive better scoring. First is to keep a more accurate list of scores for our query, which means
longer queries will return more accurate results than before. Second is that we will always score at least two
words, which helps to reduce false positives from "first last" queries.

IMPROVEMENTS

- docs/intro: mention jaro-winkler is used and why
- search: properly keep top N word scores, match at least two words

Also added are query params to apply additional filtering (exmaple: `sdnType=individual`) and we have improved match percentages to closer mirror the [official OFAC search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/).

![](docs/images/webui.png)

## v0.10.0 (Released 2019-08-16)

This release contains improvements to OFAC's match percentages to tone down false positives. We do this by adjusting the match percentage according to the query and SDN lenth ratio -- if the two strings are different lengths (after normalization) they cannot be equal. We are looking for feedback to further improve the matching code.

BREAKING CHANGES
