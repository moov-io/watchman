# Go Library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go v1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/watchman/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

```
$ git@github.com:moov-io/watchman.git

# Pull down into the Go Module cache
$ go get -u github.com/moov-io/watchman

$ go doc github.com/moov-io/watchman/client Search
