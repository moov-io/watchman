## US Non-SDN List

The US Non-SDN list includes entities and individuals subject to targeted restrictions such as export controls, import bans, financial transaction limitations, and sectoral sanctions, but not full asset freezes.

Watchman downloads and parses the Non-SDN data using [the OFAC reader and models](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/watchman/pkg/sources/ofac).
